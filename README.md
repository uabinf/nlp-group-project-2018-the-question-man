This project explores RNN for predicting text choices.

## Explore neural networks

The first notebook is focused on understanding the basics
of neural networks, the operations the represent, and the 
influence of meta-parameters.

It hand implements a simple NN and explores how teaching it 
to count, i.e. add one to the previous number.
